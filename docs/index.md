# Welcome to my Homepage
I am an undergraduate of Seoul National University majoring in Mathematical Sciences from 2016.
My double-major is Statistics.
Also, I served as the student president of the department. I work as a part-time instructor at P&K Math Academy 

## Education
**Seoul National University**

Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Sciences and Statistics
*   Expected Graduation Date: Jul 2022

**Seoul Science High School**
*   Graduation Date: Feb 2016

### Academic Gap (2019 - 2020)

I served in the Republic of Korea Army (Apr 2019 - Nov 2020). I took many online courses and read various books and materials.

During the military service, I found out that I have to take other courses in Spring 2021 required for graduation. (Earth Science Lab, etc.)
So, I tried to build an academic background in statistics.

## Selected Assignments and Reports
*Note: For the collection of **homeworks**, later chapter comes first, so you may find **advanced contents at the upper part**.

### 2021-2 (Fall 2021)
#### "Data Mining and Lab." (2021-2) by Prof. Taesung Park
**Report:** We developed models **predicting the side-effect of COVID-19 vaccine** on potential occurrence of life-threatening illnesses. We used logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and KNN methods to obtain the models. The research is still in progress, so only the interim report can be offered.

[Data Mining Interim report(Eng)](./DataMining/interim_report.pdf)

The homeworks include 
*   comparing accuracies of classifiers made by ridge regression, LASSO, PCR, PLS models with **cross-validation**;
*   fitting logistic regression and comparing the sample variance of **bootstrap distribution** with population variance;
*   generating data and applying **linear regression**.

### 2021-1 (Spring 2021)
#### "Applied Statistics" (2021-1, Prof. Sungkyu Jung)
Note that I include hand-written homeworks, which is tidy and written in English. The homeworks include
*   proving properties of Generalized Linear Models **(GLM)**;
*   applying **EM algorithm** to the Poisson mixture model and to the missing covariates in simple linear regression model;
*   computing influence function and proving the **robustness** of a statistic;
*   finding the best predictor in a **mixed effect** model;
*   obtaining a multidimensional **confidence region** in multiple linear regression;
*   comparing models and **select parameters** using Adjusted R-squared, Mallow's Cp, and LOOCV.

[Applied Statistics Homeworks(Eng)](./Apps.pdf)

#### "Nonparametric Statistics and Lab." (2021-1, Prof. Sungkyu Jung)
The homeworks include
*   deriving several confidence intervals of **linear regression** coefficients using bootstrap;
*   applying several **bootstrap methods** includng jackknife resampling to obtain the confidence interval for a parameter;
*   obtaining significant variables by applying **permutation tests**.

#### "Real Analysis" (2021-1, Prof. Hun Hee Lee)
The file contains hand-written homeworks submitted for the "Real analysis" course. Especially, **"HW5"** starts from **page 15** was selected as the "model answer".
The homeworks include
*   proving properties of Hahn decomposition and **Jordan decomposition** of measures;
*   proving **separability of Lp spaces** and non-separablity of L_infty space
