# Welcome to my Homepage 
* * *

I am an undergraduate of Seoul National University majoring in Mathematical Sciences from 2016.
My double-major is **Statistics**, the subject I want to study as a researcher.

I live in Bucheon, South Korea. My Korean name is **한기현** (This might help you find my name on the awards list and the homework).

I work as a part-time math instructor at P&K Math Academy (profile picture on the left), and I am a former student president of the Department of Mathematical Sciences.

The homepage consists of

## Education
* * *
**Seoul National University**

Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Sciences and Statistics
*   Expected Graduation Date: Jul 2022

**Seoul Science High School**
*   Graduation Date: Feb 2016

### Academic Gap (2019 - 2020)

I served in the Republic of Korea Army (Apr 2019 - Nov 2020).

During the military service, I was aware that I have to take other courses in Spring 2021 required for graduation, such as the “Earth and Environmental Sciences Lab.” course. Thus, I tried to gain background knowledge of graduate study and studied several statistics books and materials.

_Note: For the collection of **homework**, later chapter comes first, so you may find **advanced contents at the upper part**._

### 2021-2 (Fall 2021)
#### "Data Mining and Lab." (2021-2, Prof. Taesung Park)
**Report:** We developed models **predicting the side-effects of the COVID-19 vaccines** on the potential occurrence of life-threatening illnesses. We used logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and KNN methods to obtain the models. The research is still in progress, so only the interim report can be offered.
