*   Title: "Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem: Spatial clustering-based Bundling and Allocation Heuristics, Postponement, and Hierarchical Order Classification"

We propose algorithms and heuristics to solve the Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Window (DPDPTW). We observe the inherent difficulties of this problem: online property, uncertainties, and computational challenges. We review prior studies that considered online characteristics of the problem and suggest the necessity to reflect spatio-temporal features to ameliorate the performance of a policy. Then we develop bundling and assignment methods based on spatial paired-clustering of orders and a postponement strategy to gather information to overcome the uncertainty. Running simulations to attain optimal parameters - cluster diameter and postponement time, we deduce that service level has significantly improved with the new policy, which leads to stable performance and high satisfaction of all players in the delivery platform when implemented in the actual situation.
