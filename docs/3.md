## Research 3 (Unit Root Tests for Panel Data, Jun 2021 - Aug 2021)
*   Title: Unit root tests for Panel Data and Application to World Temperature Data

We analyze various unit root tests for panel data, which can be considered as time series for multiple objects and is common in a wide variety of fields, including econometrics. We introduce the Dickey-Fuller test (DF) and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF), which are well-known unit root tests in time series analysis, by stating the asymptotic distributions by each of their conditions. Moreover, we investigate the methodologies of unit root tests for panel datasets, including the IPS test of Im _et al._ (2003). In temperature data analysis, we consider the model of linearity and seasonality and apply the panel unit root tests after removing the seasonal term. In this process, we fill up missing values and verify the autocorrelation in the error term with the Bonferroni test. We conclude that the unit root does not exist in the data, which implies that the non-seasonal term is stationary.
