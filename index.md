# Welcome to my Homepage
I am an undergraduate of Seoul National University majoring in Mathematical Sciences from 2016.
My double-major is Statistics.

## Education
**Seoul National University**
Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Sciences and Statistics
*   Expected Graduation Date: Jul 2022

**Seoul Science High School**
*   Graduation Date: Feb 2016

### Academic Gap (2019 - 2020)

I served in the Republic of Korea Army (Apr 2020 - Nov 2021). I took many online courses and read various books and materials.

During the military service, I found out that I have to take other courses in Spring 2021 required for graduation. (Earth Science Lab, etc.)
So, I tried to build an academic background in statistics.

**Preview**
> Finished Ch5. Markov chain of “Probability: Theory and Examples” - R. Durrett
> “Mathematical Statistics: Basic Ideas and Selected Topics” _by P.J. Bickel and K.A. Doksum_
> Real analysis of “Real and Complex Analysis” _by W. Rudin_
> “Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis” _by D. Montgomery, E. A. Peck, and G. Vining_
> Seoul National University “Time series analysis” lecture notes _by S. Cho_

**Review**
> “Mathematical Statistics” _by W. Kim_
> “Principles of Mathematical Analysis” _by W. Rudin_

## Selected Assignments and Reports
*Note: For the collection of **homeworks**, later chapter comes first, so you may find **advanced contents at the upper part**.

### 2021-2 (Fall 2021)
#### "Data Mining and Lab." (2021-2)
**Report:** We developed models predicting the effect of COVID-19 vaccine on potential occurrence of life-threatening illnesses. We used logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and KNN methods to obtain the models. The research is still in progress, so only the interim report can be offered.

[Interim_report(Eng)](./DataMining/interim_report.pdf)

The homeworks include 
*   comparing accuracies of classifiers made by ridge regression, LASSO, PCR, PLS models;
*   fitting logistic regression and obtaining the variance of bootstrap distribution;
*   generating data and applying linear regression.

[Homeworks(Eng)](./DataMining/data_mining.pdf)


### 2021-1 (Spring 2021)
#### "Applied Statistics" (2021-1)
Note that I include hand-written homeworks, which is tidy and written in English. The homeworks include
*   properties of Generalized Linear Models
*   applying EM algorithm to the Poisson mixture model and to the missing covariates in simple linear regression model
*   computing influence function and proving the robustness of a statistic
*   finding the best predictor in a mixed effect model
*   obtaining a multidimensional confidence region in multiple linear regression
*   comparing models and select parameters using Adjusted R-squared, Mallow's Cp, and LOOCV.

[Homeworks(Eng)](./Apps.pdf)

#### "Nonparametric Statistics and Lab." (2021-1)
The homeworks include
*   deriving several confidence intervals of linear regression coefficients using bootstrap
*   applying several bootstrap methods includng jackknife resampling to obtain the confidence interval for a parameter
*   obtaining significant variables by applying permutation tests
