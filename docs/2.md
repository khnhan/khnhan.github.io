## Research 2 (Feller Processes, Jun 2021 - Aug 2021)
Title: Feller Processes and Their Application

In this report, we define Feller-Dynkin semigroups and demonstrate their relationship with the transition function of Feller processes. We use the generator and the resolvent of a Feller process to explain the Hille-Yosida theorem. After describing the construction of a Feller process from a Feller-Dynkin semigroup, we prove the strong Markov property of Feller processes, which results in Blumenthal’s 0-1 law and the Dynkin formula. Also, the discussion with characteristic functions enables us to obtain the Feller-Dynkin diffusions. We apply the overall properties and theorems to Brownian motions and Lévy processes, which are specific examples of Feller processes. The report is based on “Diffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales” by L. Rogers and D. Williams. We rearranged and modified the contents of the book in order to resolve discrepancies that can confuse the readers.
