## Research 4 (Extreme Value Theory, Sep 2018 - Feb 2019)
*   Title: Understanding Extreme Value Theory and Application to Fine Dust Level in South Korea

We aim to understand the Extreme Value Theory, which considers the asymptotic distribution of extreme values. We prove that the maxima and the minima converge to the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution (GEVD). We define the return level and observe several methods to obtain the estimator and the confidence interval for a return level. Also, we analyze the threshold model and exhibit the properties of time-dependent extreme values to converge to GEVD. In the application for the fine dust level, we compare models by computing AIC and discover that the optimal model has the seasonal and linear trend of parameters. We conclude that the level is high in late February and has a decreasing trend. We also propose ten places of the highest and the lowest fine dust level and their confidence intervals, as well as the ranks of the regions of South Korea.
